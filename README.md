# Excel-File-Sharing-Authorization-System
A secure web application that allows users to upload Excel files, automatically convert them into read-only web tables, and manage file permissions using a role-based access system.

This project was built using Python, Django, and PostgreSQL.

**Project Overview**
The system allows registered users to upload Excel files to the server.
Each uploaded file is converted into a clean, structured table displayed in the browser.
Admins can share files by generating secure keys that determine who can view, update, or delete the content.

This project demonstrates:

-File handling & server-side processing

-Django models, views, templates

-Authorization logic

-Database operations

-Clean UI for viewing Excel tables
